The stable release of the InfluxDB server is v0.8.8, however `go get` will
fetch from master by default. The master branch in the InfluxDB repo is not
compatible with 0.8.8 so we need to check out the 0.8.8 client library.

To fetch the client package compatible with this version:

1. go get -u github.com/influxdb/influxdb/client
2. cd $GOPATH/github.com/influxdb/influxdb/client
3. git checkout v0.8.8
4. go install

This won't be an issue once 0.9.0 is released.
